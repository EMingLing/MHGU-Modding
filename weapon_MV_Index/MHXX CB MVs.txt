MHXX Charge Blade Motion Values

Red/Blue Shield:
- Boosts Axe attacks by 1.15x. Striker gets 1.2x instead.
- Boosts guarding capabilities similar to guard +1
- Blocking moves with Red Shield trigger mini phial explosions
- Phial damage increase by 1.35x
- Increases KO for impact phials by 1.35x
- No sharpness consumption when blocking
- Access to SAED (ultra) but not worth using over AED (super). You can cancel SAED (ultra) into AED (super) by pressing back + X.
- Blue Shield is very similar to Guild Red Shield except no mini phial explosions when blocking and guarding capability increase only applies to guard points
